**What is Colab**

Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs. 

**Requirements**

The only requirement for Colab is to have a Google Account. You can use your UOC account which is linked to google.

We recommend starting with the official Welcome To Colaboratory notebook. It provides the basics of Colab as well as useful links to working examples:

**Main characteristics of colab**

Files are stored with a python notebook format (.ipynb)
Notebooks are automatically saved in Google drive, which makes it easy to share documents online.
Notebooks are organized in cells:
Code cells: executable Python scripts
Text cells: and rich text in a single document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX)
Cell order does not matter, execution order does. Execution order is depicted by the number between [] located at the left side of each cell.
It supports Python 3 (Python 2 is no longer supported)
Colab works with most major browsers, and is most thoroughly tested with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
Colab notebooks are stored in Google Drive, or can be loaded from GitHub. Colab notebooks can be shared just as you would with Google Docs or Sheets. Simply click the Share button at the top right of any Colab notebook, or follow these Google Drive file sharing instructions.
